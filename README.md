- 👀 I’m interested in Electrical Engineering, Substations, Power, T&D, Protection & Controls, how to learn, how to work, how to communicate, video games, design, books,...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning building a simple physics engine in p5.js, building small tools to assist with work in Python/VBA,...
